# Recipes-Trial-2
The first go of this project I wasn't paying attention to the GitHub 
element. The coding itself was super fun and easy. But it was the 
committing the code and all that that threw me off.
This round I'm hoping to better understanding what GitHub is for, how
to use it appropriately and...fingers crossed...my website will 
actually work this time...
