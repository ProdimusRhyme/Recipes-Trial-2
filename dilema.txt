This is my second go at this. I got my recipes all set during 
the first trial but was having a hard time pushing the work
to Git Hub. It seems that the work flow between the command line,
the text editor, and github, needs to be relatively seemless. 
So I figured I'd start over with that in mind. I can always just 
copy and paste my code but I might just rebuild the entire thing 
to get the practice! 

a worthy note here...If I type in "git add ." in the command line...
it will add all the files in the current directory, and it looks 
like all subsequent directories, to the staging area. 

adding a bit more to try another commit cycle...
